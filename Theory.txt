Internet:- International Network or network of networks.

Main use of internet is Information sharing or share the information.

Internet follow Client-Server Architecture.

Client:- It is a software which is used to generate request to server and handle the response send by server. And this software is known as Web Browser.

Server:- It is a software which is used to handle request of client, prepare the response and deliver this response back to client. This software is known as Web Server.

For e.g. Apache, IIS, GWS, Lightpd etc.

HTTP:- HyperText Transfer Protocol 
	
	It is a standard protocol to communicate between client and server. 
	
	HTTP Base Client --> HTTP Web Request --> HTTP Base Server --> HTTP Response with HTTP Status Code 
	
	HTTP Status Code is a number which indicate the status of response. 
	
		1) 1xx represent Informational responses
		
		2) 2xx represent Successful response 
		
		3) 3xx represnt Redirection
		
		4) 4xx represent Client Error 
		
		5) 5xx represent Server Error 
		
	Initially, HTTP is capable to send only textual data. 
	
	Nowadays, HTTP is capable to send different type of data. Client differentiate these data with the help of MIME type. 
	
	MIME:- Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension Its sole purpose to convey type of content. 
	
		type/sub-type 
		
		text/html
		text/css
		image/jpeg
		image/png
		application/ms-word etc. 
		
	Two feature of HTTP 
	
		1) Connection-less:- HTTP establish connection of client and server until reponse is successfully delivered to server. This feature for scalability.
		
		2) Stateless:- HTTP never store client information on round trip to server. Due to this, every client request is treated as a new client request for a server.

Web Page:- page which display information on internet. 

Web Site:- collection of inter-related and inter-linked web pages. 

How to build a Web Page 

	HTML (HyperText Markup Language) It is used to describes the structure of a Web page.
	
	CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) It is used to describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
	
	HTML + CSS = Web Page 
	
	These web page are called Static Web Page. 
	
	Static Web Page:- A web page which content can be changed by manual effort of a developer.
	
	Dynamic Web Page:- A web page which content can be changed by end user contribution or some application logic build by developer. 
	
How to build Dynamic Web Page 

	Script Language:- A language which can be embedded in HTML code. And language code can be executed at client side as well as server side. 
	
	1) Client Side Script Language:- JavaScript, VBScript, JScript.
		Task:- 
			i)  Data Validation
			ii) UI enhancement like slide show, popup etc. In other word, to improve UX (User Experience)
	
	2) Server Side Script Language:- PHP, Python, ASP.Net, JSP, Coldfusion, Ruby on Rail, NodeJS etc. 
		Task:- 
			i)  To interact with database
			ii) To build statefull application 
			
HTML:- Hyper Text Markup Language

In markup language, tag concept is used. 

	<tag_name> :- start tag 
	
	</tag_name> :- end tag 
	
	<tag_name> Content of Tag </tag_name>
	
For executing HTML web page, we need web browser. 

HTML is a specification designed by W3C (World Wide Web Consoritum) and this specification is implemented by the web browser.

HTML contain pre-defined tag. Due to this, it is known as Declarative language.

There are different type of HTML specification. Currently HTML 5 specification is used by web browser.

HTML web page is a file with extension html or htm 

HTML is interpreted by Web Browser and this process is called rendering.

Web browser never gives any syntactical error.

<!doctype html>

This is a processing instruction given to web browser for specifying the HTML 5 specification is used in rendering.

Note:- make a habit to write tag name in lower case.

<html> is a root tag where all HTML tag is a part of it.

<head> is a tag which explain the header information of a web page.

<title> is a tag whose content will appear on web browser title bar of web page

<body> is a tag which contain the visual part of web page. 

Web browser ignore the whitespace (new line, spaces, tab).

For generating whitespace in HTML web page output. There are some internal entities. Entities are begin with & and ends with ; 

	&nbsp; Non breaking Space 
	&copy; Copyright sign 
	&amp; Ampersand sing 
	&quot; Quotation marks 
	&trade; Trade mark 
	&reg; Register mark 
	
To generate a new line there is an empty tag (a tag which have no content)
	<br>
	
Category of tag or element 

	1) Inline tag:- It cover the screen area according to its content  
	
	2) Block tag:- It cover the screen complete block irrespective to its content

	3) Formatting tag:- these tag convey output format of content of tag.
	
	4) Semantic tag:- these tag convey meaning of content of tag. Never use semantic tag for formatting.
	
Attribute:- It is an addition properties to explain HTML element. It come in pair of name value pair and value is enclosed in double quote.

Character encoding:- 
	Computer understand only binary 0 or 1. To understand character, there is process which convert a character into binary form and this process is called Character encoding. 
	
	There are two type of character encoding.
	
	1) ASCII 8 bit and support only English language. 
	
	2) UNICODE 16 bit and support all languages symbol.
		Computer can not directly understand UNICODE and there is concept of UTF Unicode Transformation Format. 
		
Required Tag:- 

	How to display an image to HTML web page.
	
	<img/> tag is an empty tag. Empty tag ends with /
	
	src attribute contain the path of image to be displayed.
	
	There are two type of path.
	
		1) Absolute Path means exact location of an image. 
		
		2) Relative Path means image location is according to its HTML web page location. We must use relative path only.
		
	width attribute decide the width of an image in web page. Width is counting according to pixel Its unit represent by px.
	
	height attribute decide the height of an image in web page.
	
	alt attribute represent alternate text when image does not available due to some reason. And according to W3C guideline, every img tag must have alt attribute.
	
	Internal processing of an image:-
	
		Whenever client generate a request to server of HTML web page, then, server only delivers HTML web page. And while rendering the HTML web page, and client encounter <img> tag then it generate a separate request to server for collecting this image. But if an image is already used by client then it does not generate its request again. Images are cached in browser memory.
		
		Website which have lots of images used in their web pages, they use different server to deliver the images. 
		
		So, the same logic is for video also.
		
	How to display information in tabular structure 
	
		For this we have table tag.
		
		1)	thead represent table heading section
		
		2) tbody represent table body section
		
		3) tr represent table row 
		
		4) th represent table heading 
		
		5) td table data 
		
	In website, there is special file which name is index.html and this file is treated as Home page of web site means if you use only domain name then this web page will be delivered.
	
How to link two web pages 

	There is an anchor tag and it is represent by <a> tag.
	
	href attribute whose value indicate the resource to be linked.
	
	href value can be of two type
		
		1) Absolute
		
		2) Relative 
	
	target attribute decide where it will be opened.
	
	There are two type of link 
	
		1) internal 
		
		2) external 
		
Global attribute:- 

	attribute which are for every element.
	
	1) id attribute used to identify an element using its value and this value should be unique.
	
	2) title attribute used to create tooltip of an element 
	
	I just share list of some global attribute but not its meaning. 
	
	class, style, name etc.
	
HTTP Request:- There are different type of HTTP request.

	1) GET 
	
	2) POST 
	
	3) PUT 
	
	4) PATCH 
	
	5) DELETE 
	
	6) HEAD etc.
	
Part of GET request 

	1) Request Body contains request method name, resource to be requested and separated with ? and some query string.
	
	Query String is a name value pair separated by = and pairs separated by &
	
	2) Request Header contains information about client
	
	For e.g. 
	https://www.google.com/search?q=Good+Morning&source=hp&ei=GjoQY87mDe-NseMP6byMkA0&iflsig=AJiK0e8AAAAAYxBIKjbqr5VzHgVZBTZE1oFvFtT4jRc6&ved=0ahUKEwjO28rU5fL5AhXvRmwGHWkeA9IQ4dUDCAc&uact=5&oq=Good+Morning&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyCwguELEDEIMBEJECMgsIABCxAxCDARCRAjILCAAQgAQQsQMQgwEyCwgAEIAEELEDEIMBMggIABCABBCxAzIFCAAQgAQyCwgAEIAEELEDEIMBMggIABCABBCxAzIICAAQsQMQgwEyCAgAEIAEELEDOgoIABDqAhC0AhBDOhAILhDHARDRAxDqAhC0AhBDOgQIABBDOgoIABCxAxCDARBDOhAILhCxAxCDARDHARDRAxBDOgcIABCxAxBDOg4ILhCABBCxAxDHARDRAzoHCC4QsQMQQzoICC4QgAQQsQM6EQguEIAEELEDEMcBENEDENQCOgUIABCRAjoKCC4QxwEQ0QMQQzoFCAAQsQNQRFiAEWDyEmgCcAB4AIABrQGIAccOkgEEMC4xM5gBAKABAbABCg&sclient=gws-wiz

Part of POST request 
		
	1) Request Body contains request method name and resource to be requested	
	
	2) Request Header 
	
	3) Payload or Message body 
	
		Query String or form data or multipart data etc. 
		
When GET request is generated 

	1) Whenever you type any url inside address bar of a web browser and click to go.
	
	2) Whenever you click on a link 
	
	3) Whenever you click on a submit button inside a form tag which have method attribute value set to GET.
	
	Note:- most of the request on internet are GET request.

When POST request is generated 
		
	1) Whenever you click on a submit button inside a form tag which have method attribute value set to POST.
	
<form> tag 

	This tag used for collecting information from an end user.
	
	method attribute default value is GET.
	
	action attriute default value is current HTML web page and it decide where form will be submitted.
	
<input> tag 

	This tag provide different interface to collect information inside a <form> tag.
	
	type attribute decide the interface 
	
	name global attribute which decide the Query String name in <form> tag.
	
	According to W3C accessibility guideline, input element must be associate with any <label> tag.
	
	<textarea> tag is used for multiline text.
	
	Dropdown is build with the help of <select> tag.
	
	List or Listbox is build with the help of <select> tag.
	
CSS:- Cascading Style Sheet 
	
	It is a specification designed by W3C and these specification implemented by Web Browser.
	
	Each and every HTML element is designed according to CSS.
	
	Every web browser provide a stylesheet or CSS for all HTML element and this CSS is known as User Agent Stylesheet.
	
	There are CSS properties to change style of HTML element.
	
		property-name : value ;
		
		color : red;
		
	There are three way to apply CSS on HTML element.
	
		1) inline CSS:- we have to define css properties value using global style attribute of a HTML element. Good practice says avoid inline CSS.
		
		2) internal CSS:- we have to define style rule using CSS selector inside <style> tag. 
		
		3) external CSS:- we define style rule inside a separate file with extension .css using CSS selector and this file is linked with HTML web page using <link> tag.
		
	CSS Selector:- It is a way to select HTML element.
	
		1) Global Selector:- This is for all. 
		
			*
			{
			}
			
		2) Tag base Selector:- this selector apply CSS rule on the tag mention in selector.
		
			tag_name 
			{
			}
		
		Note:- inline CSS properties precedence is higher compare to others.

		3) Class base selector:- this selector apply CSS rule on those tag whose class attribute value is class name. And this selector begin with dot.
		
			.class_name 
			{
			}
			
			<tag_name class="class_name"> 
			
			This selector is used when we want to use a style rule for multiple tags. 
			
			class_name never begin with digit and never contains spaces and specials symbol except underscore or dash. 
			Note:- My personal preference is underscore.
			
			A tag can have more than one class names spearate by space. 
			
			class base selector has higher precedence as compare to tag base selector.
			
		4) ID base selector:- This selector apply CSS rule on those element whose id attribute value is given id_name. And this rule begin with #
		
			#id_name
			{
			}
			
			If you remember id attribute value should be unique in HTML document. In other word, this selector applied only one element.
			
			ID base has higher precendence compare to class base selector.
			
			id name follow same rule compare to class name.
			
			ID name and class name are case sensitive. 
			
		5) pseudo classes are pre-define in CSS and decide some interactive style. It had : in their definition.
		
			:hover
			{
			}
			
			Whenever cursor move to specific element.
			
Bad practice:- 

	with the help !important we can change the precedence.
	
There are version in CSS 

	1) CSS 1.0 
	2) CSS 2.0
	3) CSS 3.0
	
CSS Box Model:- 

	According to CSS, every element is like a box. 
	
	<tag_name> Content of tag </tag_name>
	
	1) width property decide the width of content of tag. 
	
	2) height property decide the height of content of the tag.
	
	3) padding property decide the transparent area around content of tag.
	
	4) border property decide the colored area around the padding of tag.
	
	5) margin property decide the transparent area around the border of tag. 
	
	Total width of a tag:- left margin + left border + left padding + width + right padding + right border + right margin 
	
	Total height of a tag:- top margin + top border + top padding + height + bottom padding + bottom border + bottom margin 
	
Grouping Element:- 

	1) div tag which is used to represent a division in HTML web page. It is a block level element and purely CSS manageable.
	
	2) span tag which is used to represent a specific area in HTML web page. It is a inline level element and purely CSS manageable.
	
How many way to define color in CSS:-

	1) Color Name 
	
	2) Color Code begin with #RRGGBB
		RR stands for Red 
		GG stands for Green
		BB stands for Blue
		These have value in form of Hexa decimal number.
		Hexa Decimal Number:- Base 16
			Allowed Digit:- 0 to 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
			
			Here, FF means highest 
			
			#FFAACC
			
	3) rgb(red_value,green_value,blue_value) function 
		This function accept three value in range of 0 to 255
	
	4) rgba(red_value,green_value,blue_value,alpha_value) function 
		This function accept three value in range of 0 to 255
		and last value in range of 0 to 1 which represent opacity.
		
position property:- 

	It decide how element is positioned in web page.
	
	By default, position has static value which means element are arranged as they place in HTML web page.
	
	Allowed value for position:- 
	
		1) absolute make element position according to its position ancestor. If any parent of element has position property value then this element has position ancestor. If there is no position ancestor then its position according to body tag.
		
		Note:- when position property has value other than static then four properties are active.
			top, left, right, bottom
			
		2) fixed make element position fixed to its viewport.
		
		3) relative make element position according to its original position.
		
		4) sticky make element normal as well as fixed on some condition.
		
display GRID property:- 

	GRID is combination of rows and columns.
	
Size Rule:- 

	1) Absolute Size represent by px 
	
	2) Relative Size according to parent em, rem and %

display flex property:- 


Git Concept:- 

	Git feature give us two benefits.
	
	1) Repository means storage
	
	2) Version Control maintaing a file different version
	
We can work on Git feature in two ways.
	
	1) Local Repository
	
	2) Remote Repository

Java Script is a client side script language which is embeded with HTML code and execute at client level. Here client means Web Browser.

There are two way to use JS in HTML web page.

	1) Internal Javascript:- We write JS code inside <script></script>

	2) External Javascript:- We create a separate file with exetension js and include this file using <script src="path_of_js_file"></script>

It is a programming language and having all concept related to any programming language like C, PHP, Python etc.

Common concept:-

	1) Constant
	2) Variable 
	3) Data Type 
	4) Decision construct (if else, switch case)
	5) Looping construct
	6) Function 
	7) Array or collection 
	8) Object concept 

JS is an Object base language and in other term each and every term here is consider as an Object. 

Object contain properties and method (function)

JS have some ready made Object Model.

	1) DOM Document Object Model 

	2) BOM Browser Object Model 

According to JS, it treated every HTML content as an Object known as Node.

DOM provide some readymade function.

	alert(), confirm(), prompt(), setTimeout(), setInterval(), clearInterval() etc.

To learn a language properly we must have a skill to debug its code.

Debug is a process to find issue in code and resolve it.

Issue can be of two types.

	1) Syntactical issue:- when person have poor knowledge of language. 

	2) Logical issue:- when person have poor knowledge of problem.

There is concept of Console in Web browser and we can work this Console with the help of readymade object console in JS. 

JS is a dynamic type language which means here variable is capable to hold any type of value. 

When we initialize a variable then its type is defined.

var x;

This is a syntax to declare a variable but now it is not clear what type is hold by this variable until we initialize it.

typeof() function is used to detect a variable type in JS.

Allowed Type in JS:- 

	1) undefined means now we don't know about type of value 

	2) string is represent by a value enclosed in single quote as well as double quote.

	3) number is represent by any number either decimal number.

	4) boolean is represent by true or false.

	5) object 

Arithmetic Operator:- 

	+ for addition
	- for subtraction
	* for multiplication 
	/ for division
	% for division gives remainder 

Arithmetic Assignment Operator or shorthand operator:- 

	+=
	-=
	/=
	*=
	%=

	a += 10;  means a = a + 10;

What is function?

	We already know alert() is a function inside window global object.

	It is a set of instruction or statement refer by a name known as function name. This set will be executed when we call the function.

	alert("Hello World"); 

	Above statement depicts function call.

What is event?

	Event means something happens.

	Event Handler means on an event something perform.

JS is an Event Programming.

	JS provide pre-defined event.

	And being a developer, our task is to associate some function as an event handler to these event.

JS is capable to traverse HTML DOM as well as manipulate them.

	document readymade object which represent HTML document. 

	document.getElementById() 
	document.getElementsByTagName()
	document.getElementsByName()
	document.getElementsByClassName()

	JS is case sensitive language. 

	Function name should follow camel Case. 
	properties of an object follow camel Case.
	And there are many properties in JS to manipulate an element.

	There are some attribute of HTML element which normally begin with "on" word and used for binding Event Handler with event.

	There is another way to achieve this by writing JS code also.

		For this we have a function name addEventListener and this function is inside HTML node object.

		For knowledge purpose, Event Listener and Event Handler contain same meaning.

Syntax of defining Function in JS 

	function keyword is used for such purpose and here keyword are reserved word in JS language. 

	function function_name()
	{

	}

	function_name(); // represent calling of that function

Internally, every form element has value in string form.

+ has two meaning in JS.

	1) with number it is an arithmetic operator 

	2) with string it is a concatenation operator. This operator is used for joining one string to another type of value.

To convert a string into int or float there are some predefined function in JS known as Conversion function.

	parseInt(string)
	parseFloat(string)

Number System:- 

	Computer allow 4 type of Number System.

	1) Decimal Number System:- Base 10 means Allowed Digit 0 to 9 

	2) Binary Number System:- Base 2 means Allowed Digit 0 and 1

	3) Octal Number System:- Base 8 means Allowed Digit 0 to 7

	4) Hexa Decimal Number System:- Base 16 Allowed Digit 0 to 9, A, B, C, D, E, F

	In parseInt() radix represent base of number system. By default it is 10.

Decision Making:- Decision always have two possibility. In JS, these possibility is better explained by boolean because boolean has only two value either true or false.

	In coding, there are decision construct to achieve this.

	1) if statement 

		if( boolean_expression )
		{
			// if block of code 
		}

		boolean_expression means an expression which result in boolean. 

		if boolean_expression gives true then it execute if block of code.

	2) if else statement 

		if( boolean_expression )
		{
			// if block of code 
		}
		else
		{
			// else block of code
		}

		else block never exists without associative if block

		if boolean_expression gives false then it execute else block of code.

	3) Nested if else statement 

		We can define if statement or if else statement inside another if statement or else statement.

	4) else if statement 

Programming Trick:- 

	Like Theorem, we predict something and perform all operation based upon it. And at the last we found our assumption is right or wrong.

Relational Operator or Comparison Operator:- 

	These operator are used to compare two values and return result in boolean. 

	> greater than 
	< less than 
	>= greater than equal to 
	<= less than equal to 
	== equal to 
	!= not equal to 

Math Concepts:- 

	Let us conside a Decimal Number (Base 10)
	
		12345

	Face Value:- Digit at Unit Place, Digit at 10th Place and so on

	Place Value:- Unit Place, 10th Place, 100th Place, 1000th Place and so on.

	1 is at 10000th Place 
	2 is at 1000th Place 
	3 is at 100th Place 
	4 is at 10th Place 
	5 is at Unit Place and Unit Place is represent by 1 also. 

	12345 = 1 * 10000 + 2 * 1000 + 3 * 100 + 4 * 10 + 5 * 1

	We can also convert it in form of its Base 

	12345 = 1 * 10 ^ 4 + 2 * 10 ^ 3 + 3 * 10 ^ 2 + 4 * 10 ^ 1 + 5 * 10 ^ 0

	Here ^ represent raised to 
	
	There are some mathematical function in JS.

		Math.floor()
		Math.ceil()
		Math.abs()
		Math.sqrt()
		Math.pow()
		Math.log()
		Math.log10()
